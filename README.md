# Custom Electron Window Titlebar, Frame & Menus

This project includes [Electron Window](https://github.com/guasam/electron-window) submodule for Custom Window Frame,
Titlebar, Menu Items, Window Controls & Application Icon etc by default. Following are some tips regarding to this
submodule :

<br>

- Menu items and windows controls layout or colors can be customized easily by modifying the `misc/window` modules.
- The `windows` platform controls style is being used by default in the titlebar.
- Menubar can be toggled by pressing `[alt]` or `[option]` key
- When menubar is toggled `off`, application title will be displayed in center of titlebar.
- Menu entries can be assigned/modified in `misc/window/titlebar-menus.ts` file.
